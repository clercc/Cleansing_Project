## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The run_analysis.R script is used for this analysis. The script performs the following steps:

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the mean and standard deviation measurements.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
